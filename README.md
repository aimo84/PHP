# PHP
PHP code to modify - revise for https://7.asianhighwaynetwork.com so when it operates reasonably well, a mobile phone App based upon these features & functions can be created. You review all links seen at www.DoctorMason.us/blog then post here what your skills can do, so nobody else will duplicate your work. When someone posts code here, you will test it to verify it works correctly so the Developer can be paid over in Fiverr. 

While there are 84 locations/countries involved, 1st ASEAN & Pakistan will be developed. After software bugs are fixed then the remaining countries will be activated. The website will migrate into aws.amazon, and share our videos in Vimeo and YouTube.
